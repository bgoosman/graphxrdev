| 1   | How To GraphXR 11. Editing |
| 2   | Before You Begin...<br/><br/>Ideally, you'll have worked through _Module 10. Algorithms._ If you're starting here, and you want to follow along, you'll need to:<br/><br/>*   Log in to GraphXR , create a Project, and open its graph space., Download starting data (HowTo\_11\_START.graphxr and the starting snapshot library HowTo\_11\_START.graphxrsnapshots) for this module and drag and drop it onto the graph space.  , Optionally, download the file  [https://kineviz.com/s/GXR\_QSG.zip](https://kineviz.com/s/GXR_QSG.zip), which contains the Game of Thrones data we're using in our tutorials. |
| 3   | You can create new data or edit existing data in the graph space.  <br/>And you can select and delete nodes and edges at any time.  Let's add some data. |
| 4   | **Add Node** lets you add one new node at a time. **Add Edge** lets you add one or more edges at a time. You can create new node or edge properties and enter their values. |
| 5   | Click **Add Node** in the toolbar. You can create a new category or choose an existing one, and enter values for existing properties or create new ones. We'll add a House node and add its _houseName_ property. Click **Create** to see the new node. |
| 6   | Now we can connect a few Characters to the new House node. Click the **Add Edge** icon in the toolbar. |
| 7   | Enter a relationship name or select an existing one. We'll add BELONGS\_TO edges.  <br/>Select the Character nodes to be connected and click **As Source**, then our new House node and click **As Target**. |
| 8   | You can click **Switch** to reverse the direction of the relationship. And you can enter property names if desired. We don't need to do either one.  <br/>Now click **Create** to see your new edges. |
| 9   | The selected Character nodes are now connected to the House node we created by new BELONGS\_TO edges. |
| 10  | To remove selected nodes and their edges, at any time you can click the **Delete** icon or use your keyboard delete key. |
| 11  | You can edit your graph data directly using a table. First though, take a **Snapshot**.  <br/>Now open the **Table** panel, then click **Enhanced Table**. |
| 12  | The **Enhanced Table** editor lets you edit, add, or remove graph data. Changes take effect immediately in the graph.<br/><br/>Click the Airplane icon to display the **Enhanced Table** in a new window. |
| 13  | Click any **Category** or **Relationship** bubble to edit its label. |
| 14  | Click the property menu to select properties to display in the table. Click the **x** on a property label to hide it. |
| 15  | Any property value can be edited.  <br/>The change takes effect immediately in the graph. |
| 16  | Click the square at the far left to select rows, then click **More Actions** and **Mark Selected in Graph** to show only those nodes or edges in the basic table and to select them in the graph. |
| 17  | Click **More Actions** and **Remove** to delete selected nodes or edges from the table and from the graph. |
| 18  | At any time, you can click **More Actions** and **Export CSV** to export all or part of the data as a CSV file.  <br/>Now dismiss the **Enhanced Table** window to return to the project space. |
| 19  | Any edits in the **Enhanced Table** are now included in the graph.  <br/>Next, in _Module 12. Geospatial Mapping_, we'll work with GraphXR features for displaying data on a world map. |
