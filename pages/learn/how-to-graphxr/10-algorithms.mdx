| 1   | How To GraphXR 10. Algorithms |
| 2   | Before You Begin...<br/><br/>Ideally, you'll have worked through _Module 9. Time Series._ If you're starting here, and you want to follow along, you'll need to:<br/><br/>*   Log in to GraphXR, create a Project, and open its graph space., Download starting data (HowTo\_10\_START.graphxr) for this module and drag and drop it onto the graph space. , Optionally:<br/>    <br/>    *   Download the file  [https://kineviz.com/s/GXR\_QSG.zip](https://kineviz.com/s/GXR_QSG.zip), which contains the Game of Thrones data we're using in our tutorials. |
| 3   | Open the **Algorithm** panel to run a variety of commonly used graph algorithms against your data.  Algorithms are organized in **Path Finding**, **Centrality**, and **Community Detection** tabs. |
| 4   | The **Path Finding** tab provides an algorithm to highlight the shortest path between the two sets of nodes. |
| 5   | Select starting nodes and click **Add to Start**, then select ending nodes and click **Add to End**. Now click **Trace Path**. |
| 6   | With a complicated graph it can be hard to see the path. You can click the **Spotlight Path** toggle to see only the nodes and edges involved in the path. |
| 7   | Click **Un-spotlight Path** to see the entire graph again.  <br/>**TIP:** You can **Tag** the spotlit path nodes or take a **Snapshot**. |
| 8   | A brief aside: the **Trace Neighbor** toolbar icon provides another way to explore the paths from selected nodes (but not to a specified set of ending nodes). |
| 9   | Select one or more nodes and click the **Trace Neighbor** toolbar icon. A slider control shows the number of path steps in the graph, and lets you choose the number to highlight. |
| 10  | You can click _**Select Visible**_ to select the highlighted path, then click _**Inverse**_ and _**Hide Selected**_ to hide the data not on the highlighted path. Now back to algorithms... |
| 11  | **Centrality** algorithms include **Degree**, **PageRank**, **Betweenness**, and **Closeness**. Simply click to run, and a property and value for that algorithm will be added to all the nodes in the graph. |
| 12  | You can open a **Table** to see the new properties, or an **Enhanced Table** to edit and export results. |
| 13  | We've already used the **Degree** algorithm and its _gxr\_degree_ property to filter out nodes with no connections from the graph. You can also use the property to focus on the most heavily connected nodes in the graph. |
| 14  | **Community Detection** includes **Connected Component**, **Strong Connected Component**, **Louvain** and **Label Propagation** algorithms. |
| 15  | Again, click to run and a property and its value for that algorithm is added to all the nodes in the graph. |
| 16  | A thorough overview of graph algorithms and their uses is available in: [https://neo4j.com/lp/book-graph-algorithms-ms/](https://neo4j.com/lp/book-graph-algorithms-ms/) .<br/><br/>Next, in _Module 11. Editing_, we'll dive into details of how to add and edit graph data. |
