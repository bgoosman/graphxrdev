This series of tutorials covers the basics of how to work with graph-connected data in GraphXR. To work hands-on, you'll need to create a GraphXR account, log in, download the data, and drop it in a GraphXR project space.

If you are unfamiliar with graph data or GraphXR, the first module, [Graph Anatomy and Interface](./1-graph-anatomy-and-interface), is a good place to start. The tutorials are designed to be viewed in order, but you can start anywhere in the series if you want to focus on a specific feature. The data you'll need for each module is provided.

Data used in these tutorials is from an archive relating to the HBO television series _Game of Thrones._ This extensive dataset has been developed and provided [here](https://jeffreylancaster.github.io/game-of-thrones/) courtesy of [Jeffrey Lancaster](https://www.jeffreylancaster.com).
