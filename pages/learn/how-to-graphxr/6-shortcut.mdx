| 1   | How To GraphXR 6. Shortcut |
| 2   | Before You Begin...<br/><br/>Ideally, you'll have worked through _Module 5. Aggregate and Merge._ If you're starting here, and you want to follow along, you'll need to:<br/><br/>*   Log in to GraphXR, create a Project, and open its graph space. , Download the starting snapshot library (HowTo\_06\_START.graphxrsnapshots) for this module and drag and drop it onto the graph space. Note: the file HowTo\_06\_START.graphxr also provides this view. |
| 3   | Before working with the Shortcut transform, we'll load the Snapshot we took in our previous session right before merging. Click the expand/collapse arrow in the Snapshots title bar, then click snapshot's cloud icon. |
| 4   | Now we'll use **Shortcut** to create a simpler graph focused on characters and the episodes in which they have appeared.    <br/>Open the **Transform** panel and **Shortcut** tab. |
| 5   | To create a shortcut, you first need to select at least one center node of an edge\-node-edge pattern. Click Lines in the Legend to select all the Lines nodes. |
| 6   | Here we'll shortcut the SPOKE-Lines-SPOKEN\_ON pattern to a new APPEARED\_ON relationship that will connect Characters to Episodes. We can copy properties from Lines to APPEARED\_ON, but here we don't need to. Enter the pattern and click **Run**. |
| 7   | We've now added the new APPEARED\_ON  relationship but our source pattern is still present. Click **Category** on the Legend and _Lines_ to select all nodes of that category. |
| 8   | With _Lines_ selected, press your delete key, or click the **Delete** icon. |
| 9   | This removes all _Lines_ nodes and their connected SPOKE and SPOKEN\_ON edges. We've now re-modeled the graph patterns to focus on characters and episodes. Save a snapshot, and we'll continue with this data in _Module 7. Preferences._ |
