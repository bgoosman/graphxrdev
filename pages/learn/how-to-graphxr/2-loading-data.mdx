| 1   | How To GraphXR: 2. Import, Navigate, and Select Data |
| 2   | Before you begin... |
| 3   | GXR\_QSG.zip contains several CSV files we can import to our project simply by drag and drop.  _Characters.csv_ is a table of the characters from HBO's Game of Thrones. Each row corresponds to one character. The columns contain the name, family (house) affiliation, how many characters they killed, who killed them, and a URL of the character's portrait. |
| 4   | When we drag and drop _Characters.csv_ onto our GraphXR project space, a **node** is automatically created for each row of the spreadsheet. |
| 5   | The spreadsheet data is treated as a single category labeled _Characters_, now visible in the Legend at the top right. |
| 6   | Columns in the _Characters.csv_ spreadsheet (characterName, houseName, etc.)become properties of the nodes. To see a table of the nodes and their properties click to open the _**Table**_ panel and click the _**Characters**_ category. |
| 7   | Image URLs in each row provide a portrait image for a Character node. This avatar can be shown or hidden via the _**Project**_ panel => _**Settings**_ tab => _**Show Avatars**_. |
| 8   | Let's learn to navigate in 3D space. To pan the graph up, down, left, and right,  **hold down the left  mouse button and drag** anywhere in empty space (or click the onscreen navigation). |
| 9   | Zoom in or out of the graph with the mouse scroll wheel (or touch scroll), or click the onscreen navigation arrows. To zoom faster, you can use _**Alt + scroll**_.  <br/>Reset your view at any time by clicking the _**Reset View**_ circle. |
| 10  | To orbit the graph, **hold down the right mouse button and drag** anywhere in empty space, or click the onscreen navigation. Orbit behaves differently depending on whether you have anything selected, so let's delve into selection. |
| 11  | **Left click** on a single node to select it. |
| 12  | **Hold down the left mouse button, press the shift key,  and drag** to select a group. The Characters category in the Legend shows how many nodes you've selected |
| 13  | **Hold down the control key** to add to your selection. **Left click** to add a single node or **hold down the left mouse button and drag** to add multiple nodes. |
| 14  | Hold down the _**alt key**_ to subtract from a selection. _**Left click**_ to subtract a single node or use _**Alt + left click + drag**_ to subtract multiple nodes. |
| 15  | In the toolbar, you can click **Inverse** to invert your selection. Use _**Ctrl +A**_ to select all nodes in the graph space. |
| 16  | When one or more nodes are selected, the orbit controls will center on your selection. When nothing is selected, you'll orbit the center of the graph space. |
| 17  | Click **Center To** to center selected nodes in the graph space and **Fly Out** to see all the nodes in the graph space. Click **Hide** to temporarily hide (not delete) selected nodes. Clear your selection by double left clicking on an empty area of the graph. |
| 18  | The Information window for any single node lets you review, edit, and even add properties of the node on the fly. Double-click on a node (or click to select a node and click the Information icon (or Ctrl + i)). |
| 19  | You can use a **Table** to search for nodes with specific property values. The **Enhanced Table** lets you directly edit a category - its label and its data. |
| 20  | Now that we're able to navigate, let's go on to _Module 3: Properties and Extract_, to use properties to create new categories and relationships. |
