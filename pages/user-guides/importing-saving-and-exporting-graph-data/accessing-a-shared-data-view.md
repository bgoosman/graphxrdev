You can access a GraphXR data view shared by another user, or share a data view you create. A view includes the data and its layout in the graph space.

*   A project includes a menu of saved views which you can display by clicking the _**GoToShare**_ icon.
    
*   After you are invited to share a project, it will appear on your _**Projects**_ page in the _**Shared Projects**_ area. You can then use the _**GoToShare**_ icon to display a menu of the saved views for that project.
    

A project's sharing configuration determines whether you can navigate or edit the view. For information about setting the sharing configuration, see [Saving and Sharing Data Views](../importing-saving-and-exporting-graph-data/saving-and-sharing-data-views).

**To access a shared view:**

1.  In the _**Projects**_ (Home) page, locate the project in the _**Shared Projects**_ area.
    
2.  Click the projectâ€™s _**Share**_ icon to display a menu of the views saved in that project.
