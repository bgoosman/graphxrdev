GraphXR provides considerable flexibility in the way nodes, edges, and the graph space itself is displayed. You can:

*   Set the graph space to light or dark mode
    
*   Scale the size of nodes, width of edges, and of captions on nodes and edges.
    
*   Select an icon mode to be used for all categories.
    
*   Set a color and icon by category, and a color by relationship, tag, and property value.
    
*   Apply images or videos to nodes, if urls are available as a property value of the category.
