GraphXR provides the capability to explore, select, and group data efficiently in the project graph space.

To [_navigate_](./navigating-the-graph.md) the graph on the desktop you can:

*   Use mouse and/or keyboard hotkeys to pan, rotate, and zoom in and out of the view.
    
*   Use _**Center To**_ and _**Fly Out**_ icons on the context toolbar to reposition your view of the graph.
    
*   Use full-text keyword search on properties of the graph data to select and fly to an individual node.
    
*   Open a [_**Table**_](./using-tables.md) to fly to a node or edge (but not select it).
    

To [_select_ data](./selecting-graph-data.md) in the graph space you can:

*   Use [mouse and/or keyboard hotkeys](./shortcut-keys-reference.md) to select nodes or groups of nodes, and to add or subtract from your selection.
    
*   Use _**Select Visible**_ (_**Ctrl +A)**_ to select all currently visible nodes in the graph space.
    
*   Use the list items in the _**Legend**_ to select all nodes of any category or tag, or any listed property value, or to select all the edges of a relationship.
    
*   Use _**Trace Neighbor**_ to highlight all the nodes within a specified number of connections to a selected node. Once highlighted, you can use _**Select Visible**_ (_**Ctrl +A)**_ to select the traced nodes.
    
*   Use _**Inverse**_ to select all the nodes not in the current selection (_**Ctrl**_ **+** _**R**_).
    
*   [Hide data](./hiding-data.md) temporarily:
    
    *   Use _**Hide Selection**_ to hide selected nodes temporarily, and _**Un-Hide Selection**_ to restore hidden nodes.
        
    *   Deselect the _**Visible**_ checkbox for a category or relationship to temporarily hide nodes of a category, or edges of a relationship.
        
    *   Select the _**Exclude**_ checkbox for any property of a category or relationship to temporarily exclude it from display in tables or the information panel.
        
*   [_**Filter**_](./filtering-graph-data.md) data by any numerical property, including Date and Time, using multiple composable filters. Filter animation enables dynamic display of connected patterns.
    

To _group_ selected data in the graph space you can:

*   Use [_**Tag**_](./tagging-nodes.md) to save and label any selection of nodes.
    
*   Use [_**Collect Nodes**_](./using-collections.md) (and _**Explode Collections**_) icons to collect nodes with few (or no) connections to selected nodes and place them in special temporary collection nodes.
    
*   Use an [_**Enhanced Table**_](./using-tables.md) to select, edit, and export selected data.
