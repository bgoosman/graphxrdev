A tree layout displays nodes and edges as a hierarchy branching from one or more nodes you select.

The tree is dynamic in that at any time you can change the source nodes and apply the new layout.

Nodes can be selected using any method: in the Legend by category, property value, or tag, or directly in the graph using (_**shift**+**left mouse click drag**_). You can add to (_**Ctrl**+**left mouse click drag**_) or subtract from (_**Alt**+**left mouse click drag**_) a selection of nodes as desired.

In addition, you can:

*   Use the _**Axis**_ slider to increase or decrease the size of the tree view.
    
*   Click _**Reset**_ to return to the view you started with.
    

If you close the _**Layout**_ Panel without resetting the view, a green _**Reset**_ flag appears next to the _**Layout**_ panel icon. You can click this _**Reset**_ flag to revert to the view you started with.

**To create a dynamic tree layout:**

1.  Open the _**Layout**_ panel, and select the _**Tree**_ tab.
    
2.  Select one or more nodes to be the first level of the branching hierarchy (e.g. all _Author_ nodes).
    
3.  Click _**Apply**_ to show the tree hierarchy.

4.  Now select a different set of nodes as the first level (e.g. all _Location_ nodes) and click _**Apply**_.
