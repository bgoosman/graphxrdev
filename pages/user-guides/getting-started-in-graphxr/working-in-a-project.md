A GraphXR project represents a 3-dimensional, functionally infinite space that includes the full capability to navigate, edit, and visualize graph data. When you first open a project, its space is empty. You can:

*   [Import](../importing-saving-and-exporting-graph-data/importing-saving-and-exporting-graph-data) data by drag and drop, data mapping, or query.
    
*   Navigate, inspect, search, select, filter, add and delete, and edit data.
    
*   Create, refine, or extend a graph data model directly in GraphXR.
    
*   Run widely used graph [algorithms](../running-graph-algorithms) such as _**Path Finding**_ and _**Centrality**_.
    
*   Intuitively visualize data in the 3D space using:
    
    *   Customized [layouts](../working-with-layouts/using-geometric-layouts.md), including Parametric 2D or 3D scatter plots, Geometric _**Line**_, _**Circle**_, _**Grid**_, _**Cube**,_ and _**Spiral**_ layouts, Tree layouts, and more.
        
    *   [Filter](../navigating-and-selecting-graph-data/filtering-graph-data.md) or distribute nodes on date, time, and other numerical properties.
        
    *   [Geospatial maps](../using-geospatial-maps.md), for nodes with latitude and longitude properties.
        
*   [Save and share](../importing-saving-and-exporting-graph-data/saving-and-sharing-data-views.md) graph data to data _**Views**_, _**Snapshots**_, _**GXRF**_ or _**CSV**_ archives, or to a connected Neo4j database. You can also save and export a data mapping as a JSON file.
    

On the desktop, a set of menus and controls provide the tools youâ€™ll need to work with graph data:

![](https://kineviz.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/1719534082/01_04_01_Orientation1320.png?api=v2)

*   A _**Main Menu**_ along the left vertical edge of the project space, to open panels for importing, transforming, and displaying data.
    
*   A _**Search**_ bar at the top left, to perform full-text search on either indexed data in a connected Neo4j database, or data in the project space.
    
*   A _**Legend**_, along the top right side of the space, to select nodes by category, tag, or property, and edges by relationship.
    
*   A context _**Toolbar**_, along the bottom of the space, to display the tools available to use on the data currently present and/or selected in the graph space.
    
*   A set of _**GUI Navigation**_ controls, at the bottom right, to enable 3D navigation within the graph space. GraphXR can also be used with WebX-connected virtual reality (VR); these controls let you emulate the VR experience to some degree on the desktop.
    

## Main menu

The **Main menu** on the left edge of the graph space gives access to menu panels. Most panels are further divided into tabs. Simply click an icon to display its panel.

Mouse over an icon to display its label, or click the _**Main menu**_ icon at the top left to show or hide the icon labels.

The _**Main**_ menu panels are:

*   _**Project**_ panel, to review graph entities, set preferences, import and export data, and access extensions.
    
    ![](https://kineviz.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/1719534082/01_04_02_ProjectPanel720.png?api=v2)
    
    Tabs include:
    
    *   _**Category**_ and _**Relationship**_ tabs, to enable you to pull specific nodes or edges from the database and set preferences for their display in the graph space.
        
    *   _**Settings**_ tab, to control the size scale, display mode, and captioning of nodes and edges, to set _**2D Mode**_, show or hide the _**Snapshot**_ dialog, switch to a different _**Neo4j Database**_, and modify the project _**UI Configuration**_.
        
    *   _**Data**_ tab, to import data in standard formats such as CSV and GXRF, save data as a CSV archive, GXRF, or Neo4j database, and to save GXRF data views to the server.
        
    *   _**Extensions**_ tab, to access standard or custom extensions which may be available.
        
*   _**Query**_ panel, to enter and save Cypher queries on a Neo4j database, and to run queries on a SQL database, CSV file, or a JSON or Gremlin environment. The _**SQL**_ and _**CSV**_ tabs include the _**Mapping Editor**_ to create mappings that transform data in a flat CSV file or SQL table into a specified graph model.
    
    ![](https://kineviz.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/1719534082/01_04_03_QueryPanel720.png?api=v2)
*   _**Transform**_ panel, to transform graph data directly in GraphXR.

    This powerful suite of data operators includes:
    
    *   _**f(x)**_, to execute functions similar to formulas in Excel and SQL, and functions in MapReduce frameworks. Use this to run mathematical formulas that transform one column of data to another, or that change data from one format to another.
        
    *   _**Extract**_, to extract properties from existing nodes into new nodes and relationships, creating a new category and relationship in the process.
        
    *   _**Aggregate**_, to collect properties from a starting node's neighboring edges and nodes, apply a calculation, and write the result back to the starting node as a property.
        
    *   _**Merge**_, to combine two nodes with matching properties into a single node.
        
    *   _**Link**_, to connect nodes with the same property values. This can be used to bring two different data sets together, and also to draw explicit connections among nodes of the same type.
        
    *   _**Shortcut**_, to connect two nodes that share a common neighbor with a new link. You can use this to simplify the graph.
        
    *   _**Connector**_, to provide access to external applications for enhancing or transforming data.
        
*   _**Table**_ panel, to view data by _Category_ or _Relationship_ in a searchable tabular format. _**Enhanced Tables**_ let you rename categories and relationships on the fly, select, sort, edit, reformat, and then export the data in the edited table.
    
    ![](https://kineviz.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/1719534082/01_04_05_TablePanel720.png?api=v2)

    ![](https://kineviz.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/1719534082/01_04_06_LayoutPanel720.png?api=v2)
*   _**Filter**_ panel, to filter data by _Node_ or _Edge_ properties using multiple composable filters.
    
    ![](https://kineviz.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/1719534082/01_04_07_FilterPanel720.png?api=v2)
*   _**Algorithm**_ panel, to run _**Path Finding**_, _**Centrality**_, and _**Community Detection**_ graph algorithms and add the result to nodes or edges as a property value.
    
    ![](https://kineviz.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/1719534082/01_04_08_AlgorithmPanel720.png?api=v2)
*   _**Map**_ panel, to work with geospatial data on a world map. Nodes with latitude and longitude coordinates are automatically dropped onto the map.
    
    ![](https://kineviz.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/1719534082/01_04_09_MapPanel720.png?api=v2)

Additional functions provided at bottom left of the project space are:

*   _**Logout**_, to log out of GraphXR_**.**_
    
*   _**Home**_, to return to the Projects page.
    
*   _**Shortcut**_, to display keyboard and mouse shortcuts available for efficient navigation and data selection on the desktop. For details, see [Shortcut Keys Reference](../navigating-and-selecting-graph-data/shortcut-keys-reference.md).

    ![](https://kineviz.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/1719534082/01_04_10_ShortcutKey240.png?api=v2)

## Search Bar

The search bar at the top left lets you perform full-text search on the indexed property data in a connected Neo4j database, and import the resulting nodes to the graph. You can also search the data already in the graph instead. Indexed properties are set using the _**Search Index Configuration**_ dialog.

Search results are listed by category below the search bar. Click a single node or a group of nodes in the search results to import the data from the database, or to select nodes from the search results which are already in the project space.

![](https://kineviz.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/1719534082/01_04_11a_SearchDBGraph.png?api=v2)

## Legend

A legend at the top right corner of the project space lets you review and select data by _**Category**_, _**Relationship**_, _**Tag**_, or _**Property**_.

![](https://kineviz.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/1719534082/01_04_11_Legend_Category720.png?api=v2)

Select _**Category**_, _**Tag**_, or _**Property**_ to display a list of categories, tags, or properties present in the data, and the number of currently selected and total nodes of each. Likewise, select _**Relationship**_ to display a list of the relationships in the data, and the number of currently selected and total edges for each. When you display categories and relationships at the same time, the relationships are listed below the categories. You can:

*   Monitor how many nodes of each category, tag, property (or edges of each relationship) are currently selected. Adding or subtracting from a selection immediately updates the numbers.
    
*   Click a list item to select all the nodes for a category, tag, or property, or all the edges for a relationship. Use _ctrl-left click_ to select multiple items.
    
*   Click the colored line or dot next to a list item to select a different color for a relationship, tag, or property, or choose an icon for a category.
    

For details on selecting colors and icons, see [Selecting Colors and Labels](../navigating-and-selecting-graph-data/shortcut-keys-reference.md).

## Context Toolbar

The context toolbar at the bottom edge of the graph space displays icons for actions available for the data currently present and/or selected in the graph space.
