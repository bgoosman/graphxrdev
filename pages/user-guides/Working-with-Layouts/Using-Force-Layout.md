A _**Force**_ directed layout is a rendering of a physics simulation in which each node pushes away from other nodes while edges pull the nodes together. There is no intrinsic meaning to node position or edge length in a force-directed layout. Rather, the rendering is designed to result in a graph that is visually pleasing and reasonably easy to navigate.

For more detailed information, see [Force-directed Graph Drawing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force-directed_graph_drawing).

GraphXR uses a specific force-directed layout by default, but you can:

*   Adjust force layout parameters for the entire graph, and restore default settings.
    
*   Randomize node positions for all or part of the graph.
    
*   Temporarily disable force layout for all or part the graph.
    
*   _**Run**_ a brief force layout simulation for the entire graph.
    

## Adjusting Force layout parameters

The _**Force**_ tab of the _**Layout**_ panel provides a set of sliders to adjust default layout parameters for the entire graph.

You can adjust parameters as follows:

*   _**Link Strength**_. Adjusts how strongly the links (i.e. edges) pull the nodes together.
    
*   _**Link Distance**_. Adjusts the distance between nodes (i.e. edge length).
    
*   _**Gravity**_. Pulls the nodes toward the center of the graph space, that is, the point the view rotates around when nothing is selected.
    
*   _**Charge**_. Adjusts how strongly the nodes push away from one another.
    
*   _**Collision**_. Adjusts the degree to which nodes are allowed to overlap each other. This is especially useful in a 2D layout, to un-stack nodes projected on top of one another. When set all the way to the right, some overlap can still occur.

*   _**Z Compress**_. Compresses nodes on the Z axis to become a flatter, more 2D layout. To project a 3D view to near-2D, set the _**Z-Compress**_ slider all the way to the rightmost position. You will still be able to rotate the data in 3D.
    
*   Click the _**Restore Default Settings**_ button to restore the sliders to their default positions and re-render the default force layout for the selected graph.
    

Any pinned node is excluded from adjustment, and left where it was placed. This applies to nodes youâ€™ve arranged manually in the project space, and to those pinned automatically using a geometric layout. To release pinned nodes, you must either use the _**Pin/Release**_ toolbar icon, or the _**Release**_ button in the _**Geometric**_ layout panel.

## Restricting layouts to 2D

When exploring high-dimensional data, 3D visualization provides a powerful advantage. However, you can work exclusively in 2D mode if desired. For example, a flat 2D project space can be needed to create and share views for reports of various kinds.

**To set the project space to 2D:**

*   In the _**Project**_ panel and _**Settings**_ tab, click the _**2D Mode**_ checkbox.
    
    *   Project data are now arranged on a flat plane, and the data cannot be rotated in 3D.
        
    *   Go to the the _**Force**_ layout tab to see that the _**Z-Compress**_ slider is no longer displayed.
        

Many [_**Geometric**_ layouts](../working-with-layouts/using-geomtric-layouts) translate well to a purely 2D layout: _**Line**_, _**Circle**_, _**Spiral**_, and _**Grid**_, and hierarchical _**Rings**_ or _**Trees**_.

## Randomizing node positions

In _Force_ layout, nodes are rendered in randomized positions. The _**Randomize Node Positions**_ button lets you render a different random arrangement either for selected data, or all data if no data are selected (except for pinned nodes).

**To randomize a force-directed layout:**

1.  Select nodes using any method.  
    **Note:** If none are selected, all node positions are randomized, except for any pinned nodes.
    
2.  Make sure that the label next to the icon reads _**Disable Force Layout**_. This means that force layout is currently enabled, and your selection will be randomized according to the current force layout parameters.
    
3.  ![](https://kineviz.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/1719537882/08_01_05_RandomizeForce1440.png?api=v2)
    
    Click the _**Randomize Node Positions**_ button to render a different random force layout for your selection.
    

## Disabling Force Layout

You can disable the force layout for all or part of the graph. This causes selected nodes to be rendered in a random, more compact arrangement that does not use a force-directed simulation. This can help you focus quickly on subgraphs of interest.

**To disable force layout and randomize node positions:**

1.  Select nodes using any method.
    
2.  Click the force layout icon. The text next to the icon should now read _**Enable Force Layout**_, which means that force layout is currently disabled.
    
3.  Click the _**Randomize Node Positions**_ button to display a different random order for your selection.  
    The selected data are randomized in a more compact layout, while the data not selected remains in force layout.

    **NOTE:** If no data are selected, all node positions are randomized in a non-force layout, except for any pinned nodes.
    
4.  Click the icon next to _**Enable Force Layout**_ at any time to return the selected nodes to force-directed layout.
    

## Using Run and Stop

With force layout enabled, you can click _**Run**_ to run a brief (1- or 2- second) force layout simulation for the entire graph. Click _**Stop**_ to freeze the layout when you see a rendering you like.
