You can export any graph state in GraphXR’s GXRF format or as a CSV archive of flat files. You might do this, for example, to share with another user the state of a project that’s not connected to a Neo4j database, to export data to another application, or simply to create an external archive. Exported files are given a default name: _Kineviz-graphxr_ plus the date and time of creation:

*   A **GXRF** file has a _.graphxr_ extension: _Kineviz-graphxr 2021-02-16 08-58-56**.graphxr**_
    
*   A **CSV** archive has a _.zip_ extension: _Kineviz-graphxr 2021-03-17 11-10-27**.zip**_
    

**To save a GXRF or CSV archive:**

1.  Click the _**Project**_ panel and the _**Data**_ tab.
    
2.  Click either _**Save GXRF**_ or _**Save CSV**_.

Once saved, the file name is added to the bottom of the Chrome browser window, and you can load it by drag and drop from there. Or you can locate a GXRF file or CSV zip archive on your system and drag and drop to load it.

You can also export data from a GraphXR [Enhanced Table](https://kineviz.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/~5fb2d973d670b8006e5d6cbd/pages/1719536796/Using+Tables) as a CSV file.
